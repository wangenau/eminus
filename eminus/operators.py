"""Basis set dependent operators for a plane wave basis.

These operators act on discretized wave functions, i.e., the arrays W.

These W are column vectors. This has been chosen to let theory and code coincide, e.g.,
W^dagger W becomes :code:`W.conj().T @ W`.

The downside is that the i-th state will be accessed with W[:, i] instead of W[i].
Choosing the i-th state makes the array 1d.

These operators can act on six different options, namely

1. the real-space
2. the real-space (1d)
3. the full reciprocal space
4. the full reciprocal space (1d)
5. the active reciprocal space
6. the active reciprocal space (1d)

The active space is the truncated reciprocal space by restricting it with a sphere given by ecut.

Every spin dependence will be handled with handle_spin by calling the operators for each
spin individually. The same goes for the handling of k-points, while for k-points W is represented
as a list of arrays. This gives the final indexing for the k-point k, spin s, and state n of
W[ik][s, :, n].
