This folder will automatically be parsed to generate the documentation.
The following structure has to be kept
* Each example has its own subfolder
* Each subfolder contains a README.rst with a title
* Each subfolder can contain one Python script or one Jupyter notebook with the same name as the subfolder
* For other files a download button will be generated
* Comments that should be displayed as text start with # #
* Comments that should be displayed in code blocks start with #
* Images should be saved as pngs with unique names
* Each image should be referenced in the example code in a comment starting with # #
