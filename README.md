eminus is a plane wave density functional theory (DFT) code.

It is built upon the [DFT++](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9909130) pragmas, that aim to let programming languages and theory coincide.

The goal is to create a simple code that is easy to read and easy to extend while using minimal dependencies.
